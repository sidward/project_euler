# Project Euler

- I've always wanted to learn Haskell and get into Project Euler. 
- This repository reflects that desire.
- I probably won't update this often.

# Notes to self

- `takeWhile` is a good function to remember whenever filtering lists.

# To look into

- [Accelerate](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/accelerate), especially with CUDA.
